# s-shell
A simple shell I made when I was bored.

Only works on windows currently, I may add linux support soon.

*NOTE*
Because I dislike some windows commands, I changed them to their linux alternatives, but they work exactly the same way.
Substituted:

"dir" is "ls"

"pwd" prints the working directory as on linux

cd takes \ and NOT / when specifying path.

. can be used for current directory when specifying path, and .. can be used to for parent directory, as in linux.
